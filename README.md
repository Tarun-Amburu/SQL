Project: **Library Management System**
**Overview**
An online library management system offers a user-friendly way of issuing books and viewing different books and titles available under a category. This type of Management Information System (MIS) can be developed in Asp.Net using C#, with SQL queries enabling quick retrieval of the required information.
In a typical college library, both teachers and students can issue books. The return period varies for both groups, and each book has a unique ID, even if they are copies of the same book by the same author. The system captures details such as who has issued the book, the issue duration, and any applicable fines.
**Tasks**

-Show relationships among all entities.
-Save your ER Model File.
